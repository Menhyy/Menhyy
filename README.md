## Hip hip!
I'm Menhyy... or Cherlyte... or whichever of the 1500 names i go by.

There really isn't much to READ about ME, but i made a README anyways :D <br>
I've worked with a couple languages overtime, the most memorable ones being Java, JS, Lua and some of the .NET langs (especially C# and VB.NET). <br>
Other than that, i have no idea what i'm doing. At all.
